## Benefits

### Data security is significantly increased
* The current data transfer cycle requires manual and time-consuming quality-control steps to mitigate the DI risks. In this proposal, the goal is to negate quality control steps and meet the need of health authorities DI expectations.

### Widely adopted technology and vendor neutrality 
* The technology is open for all vendors to use and is intended as a generic solution. 
* No bespoke interfaces are required, reducing implementation and validation cost.
* The key point is that if anyone tampers or changes the sequence or export file the change is recorded. All tampered files are detected.

### Near-zero impact on the current user experience 
The changes are all designed to work ‘under the hood’ and will have a zero impact on current user workflows/standard operating procedures. 
In this proposal the fundamental point is the data security is managed by the software and is not exposed to the user.
