## History

Secure Instrument Link was created to improve the data 
integrity in regulated laboratories. In these environments,
instruments are frequently integrated with LIMS and ELN 
systems. If practices such as GLP (Good Laboratory
Practices) or GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) are
employed, data integrity is of utmost importance and
frequently inspected and enforced by regulatory oversight
bodies.

The [European Bioanalysis Forum (EBF)](https://e-b-f.eu) hosted a number of
workshops around this topic at its conferences. At EBF,
users and vendors came together to discuss this issue
and brainstorm solutions.

Following the second e-environment focused workshop at the 12th EBF Open Symposium in November 2019, several 
community members authored a paper titled _Improving data integrity in regulated bioanalysis: proposal for a generic data transfer process for LC–MS from the European Bioanalysis Forum_. This has been published in the Bioanalysis journal in 2020.

The paper highlighted a gap between the health authorities’ data integrity expectations and the availability of software that meets these expectations in securely transferring data between a LIMS systems and LC-MS instruments.

To mitigate DI risks and negate the need for manual and time-consuming quality-control steps a vendor neutral, secure, file-based interface solution has been proposed and presented at the 13th EBF Open Symposium in November 2020.

The team discussed the approach more broadly, leading to
a fruitful collaborartion with the [American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS)](https://www.aaps.org).

The approach is based on the open standard [AnIML](https://www.animl.org) data 
format, secured via widely used [digital signatures](signatures)
with a near zero impact on user workflows. This solution 
is designed to address data integrity gaps and to avoid 
further forced measures and process modifications due to 
inspection findings.
